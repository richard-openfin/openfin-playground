## Getting Started

Simple app to test if client libraries work as expected.

1. `npm run clean` to make sure there are not packages from previous versions
2. Install client libraries and specify desired version to test i.e. `npm i @openfin/workspace@10.1.0 @openfin/workspace-platform@10.1.0 openfin-notifications@1.17.2-alpha-1368`
3. Set the desired runtime version in `public/app.json`
4. `npm start` and watch if there are errors
5. Once app starts, check the console for errors
6. Try sample APIs by pressing respective buttons and see if all are successful
7. If there are no errors in steps 2, 4, 5, 6 we're good to go :-)
